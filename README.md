# Avito data-analysis
This is my toy project to learn geographic data analysis. Currently I'm scraping data about microwave ovens and fridges from avito since I really do need to buy a replacement for mines... I don't really have a goal yet, but it is to be found, I guess!  

## Project roadmap
* Create a scraper [[.ipynb](https://github.com/XopcLabs/avito/blob/master/scraper.ipynb)][[.py](https://github.com/XopcLabs/avito/blob/master/scraper.py)]
    - ~~Build a basic scraper~~
    - ~~Add *interface* for entering link to scrape~~
    - Function for updating existing data
* Data cleaning [[.ipynb](https://github.com/XopcLabs/avito/blob/master/data_cleaning.ipynb)][[.py](https://github.com/XopcLabs/avito/blob/master/data_cleaning.py)]
    - ~~Delete entries selling replacement parts or something else~~
    - ~~Translate everything that is possible into numeric and datetime data~~
* Feauture engineering
    - Create interesting features from existing columns
* Data analysis
    - Regular plots
* Geographic data analysis
    - ~~Translate addresses into coordinates using Yandex API~~
    - Well, do geographic data analysis
