# Avito data-analysis
This is my toy project to learn geographic data analysis. I don't really have a goal yet, but it is to be found, I guess!  

## Project roadmap

    - Build a basic scraper
    - Add *interface* for entering link to scrape
    - Function for updating existing data
* Data cleaning
    - Delete entries selling replacement parts or something else
    - Translate everything that is possible into numeric and datetime data
* Feauture engineering
    - Create interesting features from existing columns
* Data analysis
    - Regular plots
* Geographic data analysis
    - Translate addresses into coordinates using Yandex API (I think)
